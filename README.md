# PairingAlgorithm
This repository contains a flexible and user-friendly pairing algorithm designed to support tutors during live sessions by enabling dynamic, non-repetitive student groupings. The algorithm ensures that each student is paired with every other student at least once before any pair is repeated.

**Key Features**:
- Customisable group sizes
- Handling of student absences
- Pairing history tracking to prevent repeats
- Experience level tagging for skill-balanced groups
- Output support for both RStudio and browser-based interfaces
- Scalable data storage (e.g., R dataframes)
- Git-based version control for secure, collaborative development

This tool is ideal for educators, researchers, an/or facilitators who need an efficient way to manage fair and flexible student interactions in real time.
